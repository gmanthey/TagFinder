# TagFinder

This is the code repository for the TagFinder, a handheld device for tracking radio tagged animals. It is designed to track [motus](https://motus.org) tags and borrows code and ideas from [sensorgnome](https://sensorgnome.org). Compared to sensorgnome, the TagFinder adds a display to the device and displays the tags found in the vicinity every second.  

## Hardware

The TagFinder uses similar hardware to the sensorgnome:
 - Raspberry Pi (4B, other models should work but have not been tested)
 - FUNcube dongle Pro+ (FUNcube dongle should work as well, but has not been tested)
 - A display (see displays)
 - A power bank (or similar device to power the TagFinder)
 - A outer housing (some form of plastic box to put everything in)
 - cables and connectors
